QUESTION:
This is an interview question asked by Google.
Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.



const arr = [10, 3, 15, 7]
const givenNum = 10
const nums = []
arr.forEach(i => (arr.includes(givenNum - i) == true) ? nums.push(i):null)
console.log(nums)
